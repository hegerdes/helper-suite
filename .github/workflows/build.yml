  #           This is an unofficial periodic release of crun

  #           It is build with wasm support and only for the x86 arch.
  #           This release was build at [crun@${{ steps.build_crun.outputs.CRUN_REPO_HASH }}](https://github.com/containers/crun/tree/${{ steps.build_crun.outputs.CRUN_REPO_HASH }})

  #           The libs in the archive need to be added to your system LIBs PATH.
  #           See these [instructions](https://blog.andrewbeacock.com/2007/10/how-to-add-shared-libraries-to-linuxs.html) for how-to do so.
